# Attack Resistance Comparison

## Traditional npm vs Nix + dream2nix

| Attack Vector | Traditional npm | Nix + dream2nix |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Silent Dependency Replacement** | ❌ Vulnerable - No content verification after lock | ✅ Protected - Cryptographic hash verification |
| **Post-install Script Execution** | ❌ Vulnerable - Scripts run with full permissions | ✅ Protected - Hermetic environment isolation |
| **Transitive Dependency Poisoning** | ❌ Vulnerable - Limited visibility into deep deps | ✅ Protected - Full dependency tree verification |
| **Registry Tampering** | ❌ Vulnerable - Mutable registry trust model | ✅ Protected - Content-addressable storage |
| **Version Drift** | ❌ Vulnerable - Different versions in different environments | ✅ Protected - Exact version pinning with hashes |
| **Build Reproducibility** | ❌ Not guaranteed - Environmental differences | ✅ Guaranteed - Hermetic builds |

## Protection Mechanisms

### Traditional npm:
- Basic integrity checksums (can be bypassed)
- Trust-based model (registry operators)
- Mutable package storage
- Automatic script execution
- Limited isolation

### Nix + dream2nix:
- Cryptographic hash verification (cannot be bypassed)
- Zero-trust model (verify everything)
- Immutable content-addressable storage
- Controlled script execution
- Complete hermetic isolation

## Security Verdict

Traditional npm provides **basic protection** suitable for development convenience but **insufficient for high-security environments**.

Nix + dream2nix provides **enterprise-grade protection** suitable for **production systems**, **financial services**, **healthcare**, and other **security-critical applications**.

# Performance Comparison: Traditional npm vs Nix + dream2nix

## Initial Setup Time
- **Traditional npm**: ~30 seconds (fresh node_modules)
- **Nix + dream2nix**: ~2-5 minutes (first build, then cached)

## Subsequent Builds
- **Traditional npm**: ~10-30 seconds (depending on cache)
- **Nix + dream2nix**: ~5-15 seconds (fully cached)

## CI/CD Pipeline
- **Traditional npm**: Variable (3-10 minutes depending on cache hits)
- **Nix + dream2nix**: Consistent (~2 minutes with proper caching)

## Disk Usage
- **Traditional npm**: ~200-500MB per project (node_modules)
- **Nix + dream2nix**: ~100-300MB shared across projects (/nix/store)

## Security Verification
- **Traditional npm**: 0 seconds (no verification)
- **Nix + dream2nix**: Included in build time (no overhead)

## Memory Usage
- **Traditional npm**: Standard Node.js application memory
- **Nix + dream2nix**: Identical runtime memory (no overhead)

## Network Bandwidth
- **Traditional npm**: High (re-downloads on cache miss)
- **Nix + dream2nix**: Lower (better caching, binary caches)

## Overall Assessment

**Traditional npm** is faster for initial prototyping and experimentation.

**Nix + dream2nix** is more efficient for production workflows, especially in teams and CI/CD environments where the security and reproducibility benefits far outweigh the initial setup cost.
